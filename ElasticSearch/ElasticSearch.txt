Due to some heat limitations, the ElasticSearch templates are currently broken up into a few pieces. Heat limitations are
expected to be resolved in Icehouse.

To start a new ElasticSearch cluster, spawn stack:
ElasticSearch_BaseCluster.template

This sets up all of your static cluster bits. Security groups, network, master servers, etc.

Once this stack is started, either download the following two files from one of the master servers or assign a
floating-ip to one of them so that you can use the url directly from the OpenStack Dashboard or CLI:
 * http://<floating ip>/ElasticSearch_DataNode.template
 * http://<floating ip>/ElasticSearch_Router.template

It is done this way so that you don't have to go lookup a dozen values from
the BaseCluster stack's output and enter them every time you want to start up
a new DataNode or Router.

You need to start at least one DataNode and one Router in order to have a
working cluster.

Lastly, for each Router you start, you currently need to manually add it to
the LoadBalancer due to a Neutron limitation in Heat. It can not be done via
Dashboard either due to different, but similar limitation.

It may be done via the command line as follows:
neutron lb-member-create --address <RouterStack.Output.MemberName> --protocol-port 9200 <BaseStack.Output.LoadBalancerId>


This is an example setup procedure

1.
heat stack-create es-test --template-url https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elastx/heat-templates/master/ElasticSearch/ElasticSearch_BaseCluster.template -P KeyName=my-keypair -P PrimaryNetworkId=439d2ca2-d72b-43a9-876a-67cb4a6ad4a0

2.
Add floating IP to one of the nodes.

3.
heat stack-create --template-url http://88.80.174.24/ElasticSearch_DataNode.template DataNode1 -P DataNodeName=Master1


Template TODO:
1. Disable local firewall
